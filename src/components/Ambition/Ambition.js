                    </h1 >
                    <p className='ambition-story'>Growing up, Shazane Nazaraly has seen his fair share of sports cars. However, his idea of luxury has always been unconventional. Cognizant of his personal successes and an ever-evolving ambition to make great things happen, the founder has followed in the footsteps of Ares, the God of War himself. This has largely influenced his vision about luxury vehicles that not only mesmerize people at first glance but also make amazing first impressions when driven on the road.</p>
