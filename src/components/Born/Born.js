            <p className='pre-bron'>Ever since an early age, Shazane Nazaraly knew that people who had faith and put in the hours almost always succeeded. Despite the challenges that he had to face growing up, he never let the obstacles that life threw at him stop him from fulfilling his true dreams. Shazane Nazaraly knew he had to grow and push through the tough moments in his life, even if he felt he could go no further, he did. Giving up was never an option for him. Those who he looks up to aren’t necessarily moguls handed with a golden spoon at birth, rather, capable and determined individuals who earned every ounce of their power. He focuses on his missions and continues to seize countless opportunities, no matter what.

            Shazane Nazaraly always paid homage to his true inspiration, Ares, a God of War. A God who represents true courage and fight, traits in which he holds very closely to his heart.</p>
